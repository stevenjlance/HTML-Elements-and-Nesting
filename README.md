# HTML ELEMENTS AND NESTING
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of modern webpages. Any content that we wish to render on the page is done using HTML. 

## Hello World
Open `index.html`. Notice that the first h1 inside the body has been provided already for you. **ADD another `h1` element after the one that has been provided!**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML: Adding Text
**Create a profile page for their immediate neighbor.**  Be sure to include at least:
- Name
- Birthday
- School
- Interests (shows, books, subjects in school, etc.)

Be sure to include the following elements:
- h1
- h3
- p (at least three)

## HTML: Adding Images and Links
Navigate to the [W3Schools page about anchor tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp). Click on the "Try it Yourself" button to see what the code looks like!

Using the documentation on W3Schools, add the following to the profile that you are building:
- An anchor tag hyperlink to the subject's favorite webpage.
- An image tag with the person's favorite animal.
- **STRETCH**: An iframe with an embedded website.

## HTML: Adding Structure
Using W3Schools documentation for [ordered](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp) and [unordered](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.asp) lists, create the following on your webpage:
- Add a list of your top 10 favorite for a given topic (anime shows, foods, etc.).
- **STRETCH**: Add a table to your profile page.
- **STRETCH**: Add a form to your profile page.
